    "1. Variational inference, where a parameterized approximate density $q(\\theta)$ is constructed and optimized to minimize the distance to the posterior density:\n",

    "    \n",
    "3. Those based on coupling ideas (mostly in the form of coupling the prior with the  posterior), where a transition kernel $\\psi_{\\rm C}(\\theta',\\theta)$ is constructed, such that \n",

    "    The transition kernel forms a coupling between the prior and the posterior distribution and is applied only once. "
